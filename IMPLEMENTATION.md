We implemented a way to create user-defined classes for types of gear to be used as well as a way to add instances of these types of gear. This data is stored in a JSON which is read and updated with changes, as well as checked for conflicts (items with same ID, gear with same name, etc). We mainly worked seperately on different pages of the website and then merged them together. Overall, we're very close a rough prototype/proof of concept, the main thing we are missing before we have a workable system is an efficient way to display the items the user has inputted and being able to change and update variables after creation. Some stretch goals include nicer UI, actual login system, and user-specific data (currently everything is just stored in 1 JSON so effectively every user sees the same data).
